<h2> Installation instructions:</h2>
<p>npm install @inquirer/prompts => npm init to create a package.json file. npm init aka initializer in this case is an npm package named create-<initializer>, 
  which will be installed by npm help npm-exec, 
  and then have its main bin executed -- presumably creating or updating package.json and running any other initialization-related operations.</p>
